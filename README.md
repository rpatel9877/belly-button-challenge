# belly-button-challenge

Background:

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


- The JSON data can be found in samples.JSON

- The JavaScript code that was used to build the dashboard can be found in the static/js folder.
